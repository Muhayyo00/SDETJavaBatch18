Collection Framework:
Collections framework is simply a collection of classes and interfaces,which help us store the data
easily. The classes in this framework are dynamic and have a lot of built-in methods that we can
use to manipulate the data.
There are 3 main interfaces:
1.List
2.Set
3.Map
List has the following properties:
1. List can store duplicate numbers
2. They remember the order in which you insert the data
There are 2 main classes which implement the List interfaces: ArrayList and LinkedList
Both of these classes have the List properties.
ArrayList internally uses an array, which makes accessing the elements fast, but adding and
removing of elements is super slow in ArrayList.
On the other hand, LinkedList uses a double LinkedList internally.
Sets:
Sets don't allow duplicate elements.
There are three main types of sets:
1.HashSet
2.LinkedHashSet
3.TreeSet
1) HashSet:
Pros:
HashSet is fast
Cons:
They don't remember the order in which the elements are inserted.
2) LinkedHashSet
Pros:
They remember the order
Cons:
A little slow as compared to HashSet.
3) TreeSet
Pros:
They always keep the data sorted.
Cons:
The insertion is very slow
Maps:
Pros:
Maps allow us to store the data in pairs(key, value);
There are three main types of Maps:
1) HashMap 2) LinkHashMap 3) TreeMap
1) HashMap:
Pros:
HashSet is fast
Cons:
They don't remember the order in which the elements are inserted.
2) LinkedHashMap
 Pros:
 They remember the order
 Cons:
 A little slow as compared to HashSet.
 3) TreeMap
 Pros:
 They always keep the data sorted.
 Cons:
 The insertion is very slow

 File Handling:
 Dealing with files reading/writing/copying/moving files using programming.
 1. Know the location of the file
 2. Navigate to the location/bring the file to the RAM
 3. A software or a class that knows how to read/write data to that file.

 Configuration files:
 Configuration files are used to store sensitive configuration related information. Like URLs, username, password etc.
