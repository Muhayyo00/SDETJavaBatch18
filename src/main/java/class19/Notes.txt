Type casting in object:
Converting the datatype of the data. There are two types of type casting:upcasting and down-casting.
Implicit/automatic/widening is when we convert datatype from smaller to bigger datatype.
Explicit/manual/narrowing is when we create a datatype from bigger to smaller datatype.
PolyMorphism in Java:
If we are performing multiple operations, but with different objects, we can use
polymorphism to create all the objects and call those methods once.We shall
be able to code 4x fewer lines.To achieve polymorphism, we must use overriding or overloading.
There are two types of polymorphism:Static & Dynamic.
Dynamic Polymorphism is performed through Inheritance and Method-overriding.
Static Polymorphism is performed through Method-overloading only. They dont need
Inheritance.
