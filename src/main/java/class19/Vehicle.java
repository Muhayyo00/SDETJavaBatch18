    Motorcycle, and Bicycle.
Define common attributes like speed, color, and fuelType in the Vehicle class.
Override methods in the subclasses, like accelerate and brake, with specific behaviors.
Add unique methods in subclasses, like loadCargo in Truck.
Instantiate objects of each subclass and store them in an array. Iterate through the array to
demonstrate polymorphism.
