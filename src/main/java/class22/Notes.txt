Interface:
Interfaces are contracts. They are used to make sure that programmers are on the same page.
Encapsulation:
Encapsulation says to create a class for every separate entity, and define methods related to that entity in that
class instead of putting everything inside the main method. It also says to make your fields
(instance variables) private and define getter and setter methods.
Getter methods have return datatype. Getter methods are used to access the selected private fields.
Setter methods take information as value and print.They always have void method.
Setter methods are used to modify the selected private fields.
Getter methods-read
Setter method-write
