LinkedList:



Set:
Sets are very similar to List, but they don't allow to duplicate the elements.
There are 3 types of HashSets:
1.HashSet
Upside:
It is very fast.
Downside:
They don't store the data in order.

2.LinkedSet
Upside:
It remembers the order.
Downside:
It is slower than HashSet.

3.TreeSet
Upside:
It always keeps the data sorted.
Downside:
Inserting new elements
