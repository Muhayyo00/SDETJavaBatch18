Arrays:
It is a collection of similar items.
The data is stored in consecutive memory locations inside the memory. We use indexing to
store and access the data in an array.Every element that we store in an array is assigned
a number and these numbers start with 0, then 1, 2 and so on.
Why we should use array:
It is not feasible to use variables for large amounts of data.
Storing, managing, searching large amounts of data, becomes easier with arrays and loops.
Syntax of Arrays:
We can create arrays in two ways.
1) DataType [] nameOfArray={item1, item2, item3...};
String []names={"Kawoon", "Patrick", "Halil"}
2) DataType [] nameOfArray=new Datatype [size];
int [] numbers=new int [5]
