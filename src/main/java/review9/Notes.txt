PolyMorphism:
It's a mechanism in java that allows the methods to behave differently depending upon which
object we are using to call them. There are two types of polymorphism:
1.Dynamic
2.Static
Dynamic polymorphism-is achieved through method overriding.
Static polymorphism-is achieved through method overloading.

Why should we use polymorphism?
It allows us to avoid code repetition. If we have to call multiple methods from multiple classes,
and they are all sibling classes.

What do we need to apply polymorphism?
1.Inheritance
2.Method overriding
3.Type casting
4.Loops
5.Arrays

Interface:
Interfaces are like contracts which make sure that everybody is on the same page.
They achieve this through abstraction.
1.Inside the interface, all the methods are abstract and public.
By default, all the variables we create inside the Interface are public-> static->final.
  Interfaces themselves are also abstract and public by default.
2.Inside interface, you cannot have instance variables. If there is no instance field, there is no need for
  constructors or objects of Interface.
The main of interface is everybody is following the same rules and everybody is on the same page.
