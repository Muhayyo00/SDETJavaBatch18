Nested If Else condition:
Nested if conditions one condition inside another one
Why we need it?
In real life, many decisions depend on each other. If outer condition is not met,
 it does not make sense to proceed with other condition.
 For example, before we can place an order on a website, we first
 want to make sure:
  1)User is logged in
  2)User has selected some products
  3)Products are available in inventory
  4)User selects a valid payment method
  5)User has enough balance
  6)If all the above conditions are met, only then, we can place an order.
