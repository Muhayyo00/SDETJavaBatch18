Abstraction in Java:
Abstract means something which is not clear or incomplete. We use abstraction to
create methods which are incomplete, meaning they don't have a body, they only have
method headers.
Why should we create abstraction methods?
1)When we know that every child will be overriding a method, we don't need to have a
method body.
2) It acts as a template when we create a method abstract every child must provide
body for that. It is used to enforce methods on the child classes.
Interfaces:
Interface is something which is common in two systems. It is like a contract that help us
know what type fo methods should be present in a class for the class to be able to work with
other classes.
