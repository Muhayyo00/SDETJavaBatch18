Methods:
A block of code that performs a specific action when called. In java, methods can only
exit inside a class. If the method is instance method, we need to create the object of the class
to call if method is static, we use the name of the class, method name.
Benefits:
They allow us to reuse the code.
Types of Methods:
1) method with void return type
2) method with specific return types like String and integer.

How do we know when we should create a static variable:
Whenever we want to store something that is universal (Constants) and it does
not usually change, we can safely create a static variable for that.
Like value of PI, value of Gravity, Value of E.
