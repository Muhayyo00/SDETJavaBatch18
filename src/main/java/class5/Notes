Logical Operators:
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.
This is the third set of operators (symbols) that we are discussing now. We have already
discussed Arithmetic and Relational operators. These are the symbols that we use for
logical operators in java ( ||, &&, !).
Not (!):
Not operator is going to reverse the condition.
If the condition is true its going to make it false, and if the condition is false, it is going
to make it true.
Why should we use NOT !:
When we have an un even set we can use the NOT! to simplify our if condition.
Logical OR (||) operator:
When we have to combine multiple conditions in such a way that as soon as one
condition becomes true. the overall result should be true, we can use the logical OR operator.
Logical AND (&&) Operator:
When we have to combine multiple conditions in such a way that as soon as one of the conditions
becomes false, then overall result is false. It only returns true when all the conditions are true.
Switch statements:
Switch statements are basically same as else if statements, but they give us better performance,
 i.e. executes faster. But, it is also very limited.
