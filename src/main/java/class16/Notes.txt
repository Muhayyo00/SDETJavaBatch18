Inheritance:
Inheritance allows us to build classes from existing classes. We can inherit fields
and methods from existing classes if we need them in other classes.
There are 5 major types of inheritance:
1) single inheritance (1 parent, 1 child)
2) Hierarchical inheritance (1 parent, several children)
3) Multilevel inheritance (children inherit from parents and parent inherit from grandparents)
4) Multiple inheritance (multiple parent classes and a single child/derived class. This is NOT allowed
in Java).
5) Hybrid inheritance (all inheritance types mixed up together)
